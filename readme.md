## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
This project is a website for De La Salle University (DLSU) that aims to provide comprehensive information about the university’s academic programs, admissions, campus facilities, events, and student services. The website's purpose is to serve as an accessible and user-friendly platform for prospective and current students, faculty, and staff, offering essential resources such as course catalogs, news updates, and student support services.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
